16 bit machine , a char will take 1 byte which is a total of eight bits 

Operators - c supports 8 different operators to get your job done
1) Arithmetic Operator(+,-,*,/,%) 2) Relational Operator 3) Logical operator 4) Assignment operator 5) Increment operator / decrement operator 
6) Conditional operator 7) Bitwise operator 8) Special operator 

% - modulus operator - in modulus operator the sign of the resultant value always depends on the sign of the first operand  

explicit conversion -float c ;
                        int a,b;
                         c = (float)a/b;
all implicit conversions will occur such that the smaller data type gets converted to larger data type 

Relational operator - < , <= , > , >= , == , =!   always gives the result in form of TRUE or FALSE ,  1 or 0 ;

Logical Operator - && , || 

Assignment operator - = 
++a - first increment than assign the value 
a++ - 


in any expression all the increment and decrement are evaluated first and then value is assigned to the variable . 

P= ++ a + ++a ; //a =5 initially than P =14 because of the above principle 

a=`10 , b=15 , c=3 ;

Z= a++ + ++b + c-- ; 
P= ++b + ++b ;
R= C-- + C--
